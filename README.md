# Pizza Ordering System Database

This project includes SQL statements and database schema definitions for a pizza ordering system. It consists of tables representing customer information, pizza details, orders, and the relationships between them. Additionally, SQL queries are provided to calculate total revenues for customers and orders.

## Database Schema

The database schema is defined using SQL CREATE TABLE statements:

### Customer Table
- Represents customer information.
- Fields: customer_id (primary key), customer_name, phone_number.

### Pizza Table
- Represents pizza information.
- Fields: pizza_id (primary key), pizza_type, pizza_price.

### Orders Table
- Represents customer orders.
- Fields: order_id (primary key), customer_id (foreign key to Customer), order_date.

### OrdersPizza Table
- Represents the relationship between orders and pizzas with quantity information.
- Fields: order_pizza_id (primary key), pizza_id (foreign key to Pizza), order_id (foreign key to Orders), amount.

### CustomerPizza Table
- Represents the relationship between customers and pizzas.
- Fields: customer_pizza_id (primary key), customer_id (foreign key to Customer), pizza_id (foreign key to Pizza), amount.

## Database Population

SQL INSERT statements are provided to populate the database with sample data. Data is inserted into the Customer, Pizza, Orders, OrdersPizza, and CustomerPizza tables to create a working dataset.

## SQL Queries

Several SQL queries are included to demonstrate the functionality of the database:

### Question 4 Solution 1
- Calculates the total revenue generated by each customer.
- Provides a list of customer names and their respective total revenues.

### Question 5
- Calculates the total revenue generated by customers for each order date.
- Provides a list of customer names, order dates, and their respective total revenues.

### Additional Practice Queries
- Includes practice queries for querying specific order details and calculating total revenue for each order.

## Usage

To use this database and run the provided queries, you can execute the SQL statements in your preferred database management system. Make sure to create the tables, insert sample data, and then execute the queries as needed.

Feel free to modify the schema or queries to suit your specific requirements or integrate them into your own pizza ordering system.
